## Coded by Reuben Schiopu

If you want to play the game, the best way would be to download the electron app in the distributables folder and open that.

If you want to view the source code for the game you can download the tarball in the "src" folder.

The game was fully made with just the following tools:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- CSS
- electron.js
